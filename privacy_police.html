          <span>Information automatically collected</span> <br /><br />

          <p>
            <span>In Short:</span> Some information — such as your Internet
            Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is
            collected automatically when you visit our Services.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or
            navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your
            specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
            include device and usage information, such as your IP address,
            browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location,
            information about how and when you use our Services, and other
            technical information. This information is primarily needed to
            maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
            internal analytics and reporting purposes.
          </p>
          <br />

          <p>
            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies
            and similar technologies. <br />
            The information we collect includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
              diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers
              automatically collect when you access or use our Services and
              which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with
              us, this log data may include your IP address, device information,
              browser type, and settings and information about your activity in
              the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
              usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you
              take such as which features you use), device event information
              (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash
              dumps"), and hardware settings).
            </li>
            <li>
              Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your
              computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the
              Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may
              include information such as your IP address (or proxy server),
              device and application identification numbers, location, browser
              type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile
              carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Location Data. We collect location data such as information about
              your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise.
              How much information we collect depends on the type and settings
              of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may
              use GPS and other technologies tocollect geolocation data that
              tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can
              opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
              refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
              setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may
              not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.
